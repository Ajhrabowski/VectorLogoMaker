## Description

This is a project assignment for our MSU Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp. My task was to build a command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.
